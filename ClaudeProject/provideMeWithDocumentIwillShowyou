Then, based on the user\'s prompt, it performs one of the following analyses:\n\n- **Word Count**: Counts the number of words (excluding stop words) in the document.\n- **Sentence Count**: Counts the number of sentences in the document.\n- **Word Frequency**: Calculates the frequency of each word (excluding stop words) and displays the most common words with their counts.\n\nThe result of the analysis is returned as a string.\n\nTo use this code, you need to have the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library installed. The code downloads the required NLTK data (`punkt` for tokenization and `stopwords` for stop word removal) automatically.\n\nIn the example usage section, you can replace `\'document.txt\'` with the path to your document file. The code will prompt you to enter your analysis prompt (word count, sentence count, or word frequency), and then it will display the result.\n\nNote that this is a basic example, and you may need to modify or extend the code based on your specific requirements or the complexity of the analysis you want to perform.', type='text')]
